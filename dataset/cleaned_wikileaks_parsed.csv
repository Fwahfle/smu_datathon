1.pdf,"Pristina Airport – Possible administrative irregularity regarding tender procedures involving Vendor 1 and Vendor 2

Allegation

Two companies with the same owner took part at least three times in the same Airport tenders.

Background Information

The Kosovo citizen, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative, is the owner and Director of the Pristina-based Vendor 1 and also a 51% shareholder of the Pristina-Ljubljana-based company Vendor 2. Both companies have their residences at the same address in Pristina.

Both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 submitted three times in 2003 for the same tenders:

Supply and Mounting of Sonic System in the Fire Station Building. Winner was Vendor 2 with €1,530 followed by Vendor 1 with €1,620. The third company, Vendor 3, did not provide a price offer.

Cabling of Flat Display Information System (FIDS). Winner was Vendor 1 with €15,919 followed by Vendor 2 with €19,248.70. The other two competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 4, offered prices of Euro 19,702 and Euro 21,045.

Purchase and fixing of Cramer Antenna. Winner was again Vendor 1 with €3,627.99 followed by Vendor 2 with €3,921.

In his/her interviews conducted on 31st August and 14th September 2004, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative admitted that the fact that both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 took part together in three Airport tenders put other competitors at a disadvantage, but alleged both companies have never exchanged information with regard to the price offers.

There were doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for the three tenders. The ITF investigation, with support from the Kosovo Organised Crime Bureau (KOCB), has found no reference with regard to the existence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4 in Pristina. The alleged company Vendor 3 was found to be a supermarket located in Prizren.

The above-mentioned facts are already part of the ITF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justice, in October 2004. On 1 December 2004, the ITF contacted the International Prosecutor for a legal assessment of this case.

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999. UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets.

(Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest.)

An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original contract.

DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it carried out its own soil tests.""",allegation 4 specifically vendor produce test result confirm quality work cargo apron result conflict interest interoffice memorandum staff member 2 procurement official sign doti official 1 date 18 october 2001 indicate doti official 1 authorise soil stabilisation work memorandum add work inadvertently include original contract doti official 2 tell itf order progress cargo apron tender organise geographical survey add test tender ahead evaluation report paragraph 4 suggest information nature ground appear include tender document addition letter vendor unmik peap date 27 june 2001 apparently receive unmik peap 17 october 2001 accord manuscript note sign airport engineer 1 letter suggest carry soil test
10.pdf,"""DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification.

According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to review and help him with the procurement exercise.

Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer, and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications.

DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work very difficult.""",doti official 2 explain technical detail cargo apron extension project take cargo terminal study produce evaluation company paste tender document specification company win tender demonstrate fulfil specification accord doti official 2 airport engineer 1 arrive shortly tender launch angry evaluation company allow doti official 2 send excerpt study tender specification airport engineer 1 express concern method prepare tender document engineering point view tender contain sufficient detail doti official 2 state evaluation company ask prepare tender document cost money prepare tender document send procurement official cpe review help procurement exercise assistance cpe provide primarily cpe procurement officer less extent procurement official procurement document rule doti official 2 express view procurement official cpe procurement officer technical expertise time review technical specification doti official 2 emphasise engineering expert support work time tender launch fact work difficult

The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result.

Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations.

Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.

(S//NF) In preparing for the 26 to 27 April visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) apparently wanted to come up with a simple message regarding climate change with which the U.S. can agree. Accordingly, METI has pushed three principles: technical development, energy conservation and nuclear energy, and participation of all countries in the future framework. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) apparently wants Abe to mention at the bilateral summit Japan's goal of reducing carbon emissions by half by 2050 as part of the ""Abe initiative,"" which will be announced in late May. The MFA was considering not informing the U.S. in advance of its intention, because the ministry did not expect Washington to approve of such a goal, based on the U.S. reaction to climate change issues so far. It was apparently decided at a briefing at the Prime Minister's official residence that Abe will clearly state the goal at the bilateral summit, with advance notification to the United States. Japan anticipates no major harm to the Japanese­U.S. relationship as a result.

Approach (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) Japanese climate change officials apparently plan to continue promoting the sectoral approach despite criticism from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some European Union officials. Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the Japanese in mid­-May that they are pushing too hard to promote the sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the nations concerned. Masakazu Toyoda of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry expressed frustration at this criticism then laid out three advantages of the sectoral approach: first, the approach is designed to get China, India, and the U.S. on board; second, this approach allows developed countries to avoid expending unnecessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in areas covered by the sectoral approach; and third, the sectoral approach will, in Toyoda's estimation, not result in any economic or industrial loss for developed or developing nations. One Japanese official thinks that it may be difficult for the Europeans to implement the sectoral approach in sectors such as electricity, which is already subject to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). He suggested that the ultimate solution is dependent upon the EU accepting a method of determining a figure for total carbon emissions reductions that includes the electricity sector. Toyoda claimed that businesses from several sectors  ­including steel, aluminum, cement, and petroleum­­are threatening to cease their European operations if the ETS continues as is.",tokyos climate change officials continue promote sectoral approach tssinf tssinf japanese climate change official apparently plan continue promote sectoral approach despite criticism international energy agency iea european union official fatih birol chief economist iea reportedly warn japanese midmay push hard promote sectoral approach perceive offer approach option reduce carbon emission caution sectoral approach understand tokyo clarify concept promote understanding trust nation concern masakazu toyoda japanese ministry economy trade industry express frustration criticism lay advantage sectoral approach approach design china india board second approach allow develop country avoid expend unnecessary effort reduce carbon emission area cover sectoral approach sectoral approach toyodas estimation result economic industrial loss developed develop nation japanese official think difficult europeans implement sectoral approach sector electricity subject emissions trading scheme ets suggest ultimate solution dependent eu accept method determine figure total carbon emission reduction include electricity sector toyoda claim business sector include steel aluminum cement petroleumare threaten cease european operation ets continue

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Officials in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) appeared recently to be seeking ways to prevent damage to relations with the U.S. over the ministry's decision to delay the importation of U.S.-­origin cherries, a decision driven by Japanese politicians and growers. MAFF was alarmed by the very strong reaction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Tokyo's ruling that imports could not commence until the end of this month, when a pilot program involving inspections in the U.S. Pacific Northwest by a MAFF inspector is expected to be concluded satisfactorily. One approach under consideration is to have the ministry admit to Washington, through back channels, that the decision had been the product of political pressure. Also, it was recommended that the U.S. be notified that­­unlike in the beef dispute­­imports could begin as soon as the result of on­site inspection is confirmed, rather than after the inspector had returned to Japan and more tests conducted. The principal fear among the Japanese is that the issue will become similarly politicized, possibly at senior levels, in Washington.

110.pdf,"The EU and Japan were engaged as of early December in strategy sessions aimed at a common handling policy to deal with potential U.S. moves in the Doha Round negotiations. There was a conviction in both Brussels and Tokyo, according to Japanese reporting, that great care must be taken to avoid falling prey to U.S. moves designed to extort concessions through exaggerated initial demands. Regarding U.S. domestic supports for agriculture, for example, Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Toshikatsu Matsuoka and EU Agriculture Commissioner Marianne Fischer-Boel recently pondered whether to jump-start the negotiations by asking the U.S. for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports. The problem for the EU, it was noted, is whether or not the proposed $17 billion mark is an acceptable point of departure, since U.S. supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the breadth of market access that Brussels put on the table last July. A figure of $14 to $15 billion would be more in line with the EU's thinking, Fischer-Boel indicated. The EU also had concerns that Washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special products. As for sensitive products, Fischer-Boel's deputy chef de cabinet, Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, hinted to the Japanese that the EU may be willing to go lower than its current official limit of 8 percent, possibly as low as 4 to 5 percent; however, that would be hard for Japan to accept. Borchardt also tried to allay Japanese fears that the EU might try again to enter into a bilateral, under-the-table deal with the U.S. (as had happened in Cancun in 2003), saying that Brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back-door actions.",eu japan engage early december strategy session aim common handling policy deal potential move doha round negotiation conviction brussels tokyo accord japanese report great care take avoid fall prey move design extort concession exaggerated initial demand domestic support agriculture example japanese minister agriculture forestry fisheries toshikatsu matsuoka eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischerboel recently ponder jumpstart negotiation ask specific dollar figure reduce support problem eu note propose 17 billion mark acceptable point departure support level judge way comparable breadth market access brussels table july figure 14 15 billion line eus think fischerboel indicate eu concern washington head showdown develop country special product sensitive product fischerboels deputy chef de cabinet klausdieter borchardt hint japanese eu willing low current official limit 8 percent possibly low 4 5 percent hard japan accept borchardt try allay japanese fear eu try enter bilateral underthetable deal happen cancun 2003 say brussels learn lesson respect backdoor action

Merkel and Sarkozy, evidently brooking no excuses with respect to Italy's current predicament, pressured the PM to announce strong, concrete palliatives and then to implement them in order to show that his government is serious about its debt problem. Sarkozy was said to have told Berlusconi that while the latter's claims about the solidity of the Italian banking system may be true in theory, financial institutions there could soon ""pop"" like the cork in a champagne bottle, that ""words are no longer enough,"" and that Berlusconi must now ""make decisions."" Also on the 24th, Valentini indicated that EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy had urged Italy to undertake policies aimed at reducing the impression within the EU that the country is weighed down with an enormous debt at a moment in time when it also is struggling with low productivity and showing little dynamism. In Van Rompuy's opinion, Spain is the model that Italy should now be seeking to emulate.",22 october meeting attend german chancellor angela merkel french president nicolas sarkozy italian prime minister pm silvio berlusconi later describe italians personal adviser international relation valentino valentini tense harsh rome government merkel sarkozy evidently brook excuse respect italys current predicament pressure pm announce strong concrete palliative implement order government debt problem sarkozy say tell berlusconi latter claim solidity italian banking system true theory financial institution soon pop like cork champagne bottle word long berlusconi decision 24th valentini indicate eu council president herman van rompuy urge italy undertake policy aim reduce impression eu country weigh enormous debt moment time struggle low productivity show little dynamism van rompuys opinion spain model italy seek emulate

Speaking with Italian Prime Minister (PM) Silvio Berlusconi, Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu insisted that the trigger for the dispute--Israel's decision to build 1,600 homes in contested East Jerusalem--was totally in keeping with national policy dating back to the administration of Golda Meir, and blamed this mishandling on a government official with poor political sensitivity. The objective now, Netanyahu said, is to keep the Palestinians from using this issue as a pretext to block a resumption of talks or to advance unrealistic claims that could risk sinking the peace negotiations altogether. Continuing, he asserted that the tension has only been heightened by the absence of direct contact between himself and the U.S. President. In response, Berlusconi promised to put Italy at Israel's disposal in helping mend the latter's ties with Washington. Other Israeli officials, meanwhile, believed that this tiff goes far beyond merely the question of the construction plans, marking instead the lowest point in U.S.-Israeli relations in memory.",israel reach europe include italy help smooth current rift relation united states accord italian diplomatic reporting 13 march speak italian prime minister pm silvio berlusconi israeli pm binyamin netanyahu insist trigger disputeisrael decision build 1600 home contested east jerusalemwas totally keep national policy date administration golda meir blame mishandle government official poor political sensitivity objective netanyahu say palestinians issue pretext block resumption talk advance unrealistic claim risk sink peace negotiation altogether continue assert tension heighten absence direct contact president response berlusconi promise italy israels disposal help mend latter tie washington israeli official believe tiff go far merely question construction plan mark instead low point usisraeli relation memory
113.pdf,"Japan, preparing for its role as chairman of the Group-of-8 (G-8) summit at Lake Toya early in July, has given notice that it intends to strive for a long-term commitment on climate change with specific figures, while Germany believes that the crucial issue at the summit is whether the U.S. will accept going beyond Heiligendamm (the site of last year's G-8 summit) language in the framework of the G-8 if the emerging countries do not accept numerical targets at the Major Economies Meeting (MEM). (According to press reports, leaders from 16 countries, including the members of the G-8 plus China, India, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, South Africa, and Mexico, plan to discuss climate change on the margins of the G-8 summit in Japan.) Masaharu Kono, Japan's G-8 sherpa, emphasized Tokyo's position in an exchange with his German counterpart, Bernd Pfaffenback, on 17 June, while Pfaffenback provided his country's take on the issues to be addressed at Lake Toya. The German also noted that, in response to a U.S. request, his country would likely give up its demand for a 25- to 45-percent mid-term carbon dioxide reduction at the MEM. In addition, he does not believe that the emerging economies are willing to go beyond the Bali language at present, his feeling being that they prefer instead to wait until next year's G-8 summit in Copenhagen, because they do not wish to give up things now that they might be prepared to give up later. It is also Pfaffenback's position that a failure of the emerging economies to accept a long-term goal with numbers, even in brackets, would pose difficulties for the G-8 and possibly lead to a clash at the summit itself if there is no fallback position.",japan prepare role chairman groupof8 g8 summit lake toya early july give notice intend strive longterm commitment climate change specific figure germany believe crucial issue summit accept go heiligendamm site year g8 summit language framework g8 emerge country accept numerical target major economies meeting mem accord press report leader 16 country include member g8 plus china india brazil australia indonesia south korea south africa mexico plan discuss climate change margin g8 summit japan masaharu kono japans g8 sherpa emphasize tokyos position exchange german counterpart bernd pfaffenback 17 june pfaffenback provide countrys issue address lake toya german note response request country likely demand 25 45percent midterm carbon dioxide reduction mem addition believe emerge economy willing bali language present feeling prefer instead wait year g8 summit copenhagen wish thing prepare later pfaffenback position failure emerge economy accept longterm goal number bracket pose difficulty g8 possibly lead clash summit fallback position

He believes that the mid-December EU Summit in Brussels will impact on the UN Conference on Climate Change in Poznan as well as the 2009 Copenhagen Talks, stressing that without positive signals and continued leadership from the EU, it would be difficult for the UN to make a commitment in Poznan. Ban also maintained that since the new U.S. administration will have a very engaging and proactive attitude on the issue, the time is right for the EU and the whole world to create conditions necessary for reaching a meaningful deal at the 2009 UN Climate Talks. In that regard, Ban considered the Poznan Conference to be very important as a ""bridge"" toward Copenhagen. Ban also praised Merkel for her personal efforts regarding the issue of combating climate change and for encouraging other EU leaders to agree on the issue. For her part, Merkel was optimistic that the EU Summit would come to an agreement, although she acknowledged that the tough issue would involve carbon dioxide trading. Both Ban and Merkel favored holding a mini-summit in early 2009 to involve the new U.S. administration, believing that it is important to get a clear idea of U.S. intentions.

In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) was provided with a copy of a letter dated 28 May 2004, from the Cargo Manager of an Airline to a Staff Member of Public Enterprise Airport Pristina.

At the time, Pristina Airport staff could not locate a record of this invoice in the airport’s financial records, and, therefore, the commission of fraud on the part of staff in the Cargo Department was suspected.""",allegation july 2004 investigation task force itf provide copy letter date 28 2004 cargo manager airline staff member public enterprise airport pristina letter cargo manager refer problem relative invoice april 2004 issue cargo department pristina airport handling outgoing mail member states kfor time pristina airport staff locate record invoice airport financial record commission fraud staff cargo department suspect

Pristina Airport is the Airline’s cargo handling agent for both imports and exports and the Airline is the Member State’s KFOR’s mail handling agent. Pristina Airport collects mail-handling revenues on behalf of the Airline and deposits these revenues to the airline’s bank account after deducting the appropriate commission.

The issues identified in the letter by the Airline Cargo Manager related to the high rate (€0.50/kg) charged by Pristina Airport for handling outgoing mail; the fact that the Invoice had been incorrectly sent to the Member State’s KFOR instead of their agent, the Airline; and the inappropriate addition of Value Added Tax (VAT), which is not applicable to international traffic.""",background pristina airport airlines cargo handle agent import export airline member states kfors mail handle agent pristina airport collect mailhandle revenue behalf airline deposit revenue airlines bank account deduct appropriate commission issue identify letter airline cargo manager relate high rate 050 kg charge pristina airport handle outgoing mail fact invoice incorrectly send member states kfor instead agent airline inappropriate addition value add tax vat applicable international traffic

In particular, the use of the assets allocated to the ATCS by the KTA in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the ATCS Finance Office in that respect was unsatisfactory. This poor performance even caused financial damage to the UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA, as demonstrated in this report. The work of the ATCS Finance Office was under direct supervision of the ATCS Official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the Division Manager.

2.pdf,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION A review of the airport’s bank accounts and documents related to airport operations, contracts, and financial matters revealed a number of cash withdrawals from the ATCS bank account, many of them in €10.000 increments. Between July 2002 and November 2003, an amount of €642.000 was withdrawn in cash. The majority of the withdrawals were identified as being for air travel and related expenses for the then the ATCS Official; similarly for other ATCS employees; and also for the so-called ‘petty cash’ purposes. The forensic audit report of February 2003 highlighted that the ATCS Official travelled frequently and questioned whether the trips were necessary, or were approved. It was established that on 01 July 2002, the new Division Manager, Airport Sector UNMIK Pillar 4 was appointed with overall responsibility for Pristina Airport. The ATCS Official was in charge of the Department, which included day to-day management of the ATCS Finance Office.

At the time of these incidents, two photocopying assistants had been working on an ad hoc basis at the finance office and had access to departmental files. Photocopying Assistant 1 was a relative of The Finance Department Supervisor, and Photocopying Assistant 2, was the daughter of Finance Assistant 2. Photocopying Assistant 2 assisted her father periodically without pay. OIOS was informed that the two assistants helped in the preparation of the end of month financial returns, which included retrieving documents from various files, copying them and returning them to the files. Photocopying Assistant 1 was working at the finance office at the relevant time period, but it has not been fully established when Photocopying Assistant 2 worked at the office. No timesheets were kept for either assistant.

Review of procedures at UNON, UNEP Narobi and UNDP Bratislava in connection with payments of this sort showed that
• UNDP Bratislava relies on the authorizing signatures on the faxes and does not verify their authenticity with the agency;
• UNDP Bratislava maintains a sign-in sheet which requires a signature and identity information, but it was kept haphazardly at the time of these incidents;
• UNDP Bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of identity, which is recorded on the back of the cheque, and the payee signs the original cash disbursement voucher upon receipt of the cheque, but the finance office does not retain a copy of the payee’s proof of identification;
• UNDP Bratislava does not maintain a mail log;
• While procedures for reconciling accounts between UNON and UNDP were in place, UNON did not attempt to reconcile the August 2002 UNDP Bratislava account for more than a year after it was purportedly submitted; and

“Hiwot Abebe” email of 26 January 2003

During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that on 26 January 2003, an anonymous person, using the identities of “Hiwot Abebe” sent an email to the President and Vice-President of the United States of America. The email was also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate. The email had an attachment that was addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”. The document was also copied to the Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior officials in the UN System.""",investigative details hiwot abebe email 26 january 2003 course investigation reveal 26 january 2003 anonymous person identity hiwot abebe send email president vicepresident united states america email address senator john kerry senator dodd united states senate email attachment address executive secretary eca highlight allegation sexual harassment rape perpetrate senior official eca eca complex title attachment crime rape maladministration compound eca document copy secretarygeneral ethiopian foreign ministry senior official un system

When interviewed the ACGD Officer told ID/OIOS that Official 2 had asked him to pay miscellaneous expenses and DSA to the participants of the Seychelles conference. He said that ECA had written to UNDP Mauritius, who asked UNDP HQ for authority to transfer funds to Barclays in Seychelles. The ACGD Officer then cashed the funds and disbursed DSA to participants.

He said that on 17 February 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the hotel in the presence of the UNDP Officer. He indicated his payment to participants on the list by placing asterisks against their names. On 18 February 1999 Barclays paid the other participants using the attendance list supplied by the ACGD Officer. Upon receipt of identification from the payees, the bank tellers had the participant sign his/her name on the attendance list and paid the DSA. The ACGD Officer said that he was present when the bank tellers paid the remaining participants and that after the payments were made, the attendance list was returned to him.""",v investigative details interview acgd officer tell id oio official 2 ask pay miscellaneous expense dsa participant seychelles conference say eca write undp mauritius ask undp hq authority transfer fund barclays seychelles acgd officer cash fund disburse dsa participant say 17 february 1999 pay group participant hotel presence undp officer indicate payment participant list place asterisk name 18 february 1999 barclays pay participant attendance list supply acgd officer receipt identification payee bank teller participant sign attendance list pay dsa acgd officer say present bank teller pay remain participant payment attendance list return

The ACGD Officer explained these discrepancies by suggesting that a bank employee might have tampered with the DSA list and forged signatures of participants who did not attend and then pocketed their DSA. He said that he dealt with the manager; a teller and a go-between person and that any one of them could have falsely signed the DSA list. However, he had previously acknowledged that he had witnessed the payments being made by the Bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at any time before being questioned by ID/OIOS Investigators on this point. However, he claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointed out by ID/OIOS. He then acknowledged that he had received memoranda from Official 4 asking him to account, amongst other things, for the moneys that he had been given for DSA, but he thought that the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted discrepancies.""",v investigative details acgd officer explain discrepancy suggest bank employee tamper dsa list forge signature participant attend pocket dsa say deal manager teller gobetween person falsely sign dsa list previously acknowledge witness payment bank staff raise question concern time question id oios investigator point claim surprise discrepancy point id oios acknowledge receive memoranda official 4 ask account thing money give dsa think matter settle despite unaccounted discrepancy

31.pdf,"""Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm.

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.

The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investigating an allegation regarding administrative irregularities regarding the insurance coverage for Pristina Airport by a London-based Company, who then purchased the cover from Insurance Company 1 between 2001 and 2003.

Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMIK Pillar II, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), the ITF determined that the responsible Manager did not undertake efforts in 2002 or 2003 to invite international tenders for the Airport’s insurance coverage. According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Administration Instruction on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a tender should have been undertaken. The Manager did not prepare an international tender for at least the period 2 October 2003 to 1 October 2004, instead, he concluded a contract in favour of Insurance Company 1 effecting insurance coverage pertaining to Pristina International Airport for a further year.

Vendor 1 Manager’s letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: replacing a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a member of the Finance Department, the Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favouring Vendor 2 in the tender process.""",iau memo reference letter complaint date 280604 vendor 1 company compete tender subsequently award single source contract supply summer uniform author letter vendor 1 manager allege existence rumour witness matter bribery procurement officer 1 pristina airport finance officer pristina airport vendor 1 managers competitor tender process vendor 2 vendor 1 managers letter identify intention seek legal action procurement officer 1 allegedly violate procurement rule replace member bid evaluation committee competitive tender allow member finance department finance officer sit committee favour vendor 2 tender process

Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive tender for the supply of uniforms. In addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitted bids following which Procurement Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Committee on 10-06-04. Present, in addition to the committee that comprised members of the various airport work groups, were representatives of the three bidding companies including Vendor 1 Manager.

Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the offerings of the competitors, which comprised a range of uniforms and accessories for the various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-04, the committee, though not satisfied with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasibility of no-cost design changes to one of the uniforms for women employees. The committee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the request of Pristina Airport Official. During the meeting, Pristina Airport Official announced the cancellation of the tender.

Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee, Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee member 2, who then attended the second session for continuity purposes. Committee member 1 and Committee member 2 confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for the replacement.
Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately included the Finance Officer in the Bid Evaluation Committee

The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1, and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluation Committee. However, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said that the other had nominated the Finance Officer to the committee.
KTA legal staff advised the ITF that the wisdom of allowing a representative of the Finance Department to participate in bid evaluations is questionable because, generally, officers whose function involves payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due. According to KTA legal staff, however, such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes only an “approving officer” from the Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contract from serving as a tender evaluator.

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by conducting interviews with all relevant persons; obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from the Pillar IV administration, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hangar, fuel storage facilities and equipment.

Although PEAP Official as the responsible official at that time denied that he/she had requested Vendor 2 Representative support for the FIDS supply and cabling procurements, Vendor 2 Representative granted the ITF that he/she acted on PEAP Official’s request.

Nevertheless, PEAP official bears the overall responsibility for his/her department (PEAP), and this investigation proved again that he/she did not fully meet the requirements as manager in a sensitive area like the Airport.

The entire matter has to be seen as an administrative irregularity. It is obvious that international procurement rules had been breached but the Procurement Regulation that was in force at that
time - Financial Agreement 1999/2 - does not indicate cases like described before.

Furthermore, to prove a possible case of corruption, there are not enough indications.""",conclusion peap official responsible official time deny request vendor 2 representative support fids supply cable procurement vendor 2 representative grant itf act peap official request peap official bear overall responsibility department peap investigation prove fully meet requirement manager sensitive area like airport entire matter see administrative irregularity obvious international procurement rule breach procurement regulation force time financial agreement 1999 2 indicate case like describe furthermore prove possible case corruption indication
44.pdf,"Allegation

An official of a non-Airport related company, supported the procurement process for the supply of the Flat Information Display System (FIDS) by writing the recommendation and justification for a Single source procurement and also defined the technical specifications. As Vendor 1 was only able to supply but not to cable the FIDS, another tender had to be launched for the FIDS cabling. Winner of this tender was Vendor 2.

Background Information

The Single Source Procurement (Purchase and supply of FIDS) started on 17 October 2002 with a written recommendation and justification by Vendor 2 Representative. The purchase of additional FIDS became necessary because of the expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building. The already existing system had been provided by Vendor 1, therefore the Airport Management decided to choose Vendor 1 again.

The Capital Expenditure Approval and contract were signed on 13 December 2002. The procurement file does not show why Vendor 1 only delivered the FIDS but did not cable it. The need for cabling the FIDS resulted in another tender that commenced in March 2004. According to the procurement file it appeared that Vendor 2 won the Competitive Shopping tender with an amount of 15.919 Euro.",allegation official nonairport relate company support procurement process supply flat information display system fids write recommendation justification single source procurement define technical specification vendor 1 able supply cable fids tender launch fids cable winner tender vendor 2 background information single source procurement purchase supply fids start 17 october 2002 write recommendation justification vendor 2 representative purchase additional fids necessary expansion passenger terminal building exist system provide vendor 1 airport management decide choose vendor 1 capital expenditure approval contract sign 13 december 2002 procurement file vendor 1 deliver fids cable need cable fids result tender commence march 2004 accord procurement file appear vendor 2 win competitive shopping tender 15919 euro

The Sales Manager of Vendor 1 was interviewed on the phone on 30 August 2004. Asked why Vendor 1 did not provide with the cabling of the FIDS he/she stated that Vendor 1’s management did not allow traveling to Kosovo at that time for security reasons.

Allegation

On the 29th May 2003, the Divisional Manager, Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) [UNMIK EU- Pillar IV], approved and signed a contract between Pristina Airport and the Vendor before the Capital Expenditure was formally approved by KTA.

Background Information

On 7 March 2003, Pristina Airport launched an international tender to supply X-ray equipment. On 4 April 2003, the Evaluation Committee awarded the contract to the Vendor, who had not submitted the lowest tender, but, was the only company that met the rigorous technical specifications. The Vendor is acknowledged as a world-class company specializing in such equipment.

The contract between Pristina Airport and the Vendor was concluded on 10 April 2003. It is not clear when the Vendor signed this document. The KTA Internal Auditor 1 expressed concerns over the conclusion of the contract, which resulted in the Divisional Manager signing on behalf of the Procuring Entity on 29 May 2003. KTA Official 1 also signed the contract, but did not record the date against his/her name.

The Capital Expenditure Approval, dated 19 June 2003, was signed by KTA Official 2, on 20 June 2003.""",pristina airport allege administrative irregularity xray tender allegation 29th 2003 divisional manager kosovo trust agency kta unmik eu pillar iv approve sign contract pristina airport vendor capital expenditure formally approve kta background information 7 march 2003 pristina airport launch international tender supply xray equipment 4 april 2003 evaluation committee award contract vendor submit low tender company meet rigorous technical specification vendor acknowledge worldclass company specialize equipment contract pristina airport vendor conclude 10 april 2003 clear vendor sign document kta internal auditor 1 express concern conclusion contract result divisional manager signing behalf procuring entity 29 2003 kta official 1 sign contract record date capital expenditure approval date 19 june 2003 sign kta official 2 20 june 2003

The charges themselves, as calculated by the Airport Handling Services Department for Airline flights, were scrutinized against the published ""Price List for Basic Airport Services"" issued on 1 January 2002.

Details recorded on the ""Load Sheets"" confirmed the handling charge of 1074 Euros was also found to be correct. The landing charge of €676.44 was, however, reduced by 50% as this flight was identified as a ""humanitarian flight"" and as such qualified for the discount. The Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport told the ITF Investigators that she regarded the returning Kosovars as refugees and the discount as appropriate. The ITF Investigators checked this matter with the Official of the Airport General Services, who confirmed he/she was aware of this discount and did not dispute this interpretation of the flight.""",iii investigative details charge calculate airport handling services department airline flight scrutinize publish price list basic airport services issue 1 january 2002 detail record load sheets confirm handling charge 1074 euros find correct landing charge 67644 reduce 50 flight identify humanitarian flight qualified discount official passenger handling services pristina airport tell itf investigators regard return kosovars refugee discount appropriate itf investigator check matter official airport general services confirm aware discount dispute interpretation flight

There is no evidence that the Airline have sought to avoid any charges levied by Pristina Airport. All charges levied upon the Airline by Pristina Airport for incoming and outgoing flights have been paid and receipts issued. The charges applied to the Airline flights are in accordance with listed charges for services.

The identification of the flight as ""humanitarian"" is a matter for closer review by Airport Pristina management to ensure compliance with airport charges.

The recently appointed Senior Official of the Pristina Airport, when advised by the ITF of the number of cash transactions, was unaware that this practice continued within the Passenger Handling Services Department.

The information as to a credit arrangement for the Airline was also provided to the Pristina Airport Senior Official by the ITF for his/her action.

The charges shown in the ""Price List for Basic Airport Services"" correspond with those charged to the Airline.

The Official explained that this tax is normally collected by the airlines using the check-in facilities as part of normal boarding procedures. He/She explained that the security guards and U.K. Immigration staff who remained airside awaiting return to the UK had not technically entered the Airport and as such were not liable for airport taxes. In respect of the other departing passengers, the Official said there was no obligation for the payment of this tax because neither the carrier nor the passengers used the regular check-in facilities of the Airport.""",iii investigative details itf investigator ask official passenger handling services pristina airport describe airport tax obligation flight official state tax 15 passenger payable respect depart passenger official explain tax normally collect airline checkin facility normal boarding procedure explain security guard uk immigration staff remain airside await return uk technically enter airport liable airport taxis respect depart passenger official say obligation payment tax carrier passenger regular checkin facility airport

The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000.

It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of bids.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from a member state’s armed forces specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

On the 16th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport to hand it to Official 1. The Company Representative stated that the hand-over of the cash to Official 1 took place outside the airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated.

ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official documentation in relation to the Company merchandise. No trace of the payment of the €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department account books for 2003 or 2004.

According to the tariff list that the Finance Officer of the Cargo Section provided to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for storage fees from the 23rd of December 2003 to 15th of March 2004.""",iii investigative details 16th march 2004 partner 1 pay 800000 company representative go pristina airport hand official 1 company representative state handover cash official 1 take place outside airport terminal gate airport xray operator observe meeting man corroborate fact meeting take place state itf investigator visit cargo department finance office check official documentation relation company merchandise trace payment 8000 find cargo department account book 2003 2004 accord tariff list finance officer cargo section provide itf company pay approximately 3200000 storage fee 23rd december 2003 15th march 2004

ITF Investigators met with the Company Representative, who explained that a part of his business involves the importation and marketing of LED display equipment. The Company consists of 4 partners:
• Partner 1
• Partner 2
• Partner 3
• Partner 4

The above company partners agreed to the following regarding the various payments to be effected as follows:
• Partner 2 and Partner 3 were to pay the total price of all the goods;
• Partner 1 was to pay everything regarding VAT, Custom Duties, Local Taxes and Storage.

III. THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AIRPORT PRISTINA CARGO OFFICIALS

It was Official 2’s responsibility to ensure that storage fees were paid and a record of the payments be kept. The procedure for recording payments is that the airway bill with a customs stamp should have been provided to the Finance Officer whereby he/she then calculates the storage fees owed. Before individuals or companies were allowed to retrieve their goods, this fee had to be paid pursuant to an official invoice. In this instant case, there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment. The absence of such a record is highly unusual and establishes that monies owed to the airport were not received in this case.

Official 1 worked in the Cargo Handling Office at the Airport. As with Official 2, it was Official 1’s duty to ensure that all payments made by customers of the airport complied with the applicable regulations and instructions.""",  ii background itf investigator meet company representative explain business involve importation marketing led display equipment company consist 4 partner partner 1 partner 2 partner 3 partner 4 company partner agree following payment effect follow partner 2 partner 3 pay total price good partner 1 pay vat custom duties local taxes storage iii duty responsibility airport pristina cargo official official 2s responsibility ensure storage fee pay record payment keep procedure recording payment airway bill custom stamp provide finance officer calculate storage fee owe individual company allow retrieve good fee pay pursuant official invoice instant case record invoice payment absence record highly unusual establish monie owe airport receive case official 1 work cargo handling office airport official 2 official 1 duty ensure payment customer airport comply applicable regulation instruction

The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo conducted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a UNMIK Bank Account opened at a Bank in Pristina. This investigation was triggered by a forensic audit report of Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP) released in February 2003 by the Chartered Accountants.

The activities of the Pristina Airport fall under the control of the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is administered by the European Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption involving UNMIK, its pillars, and other organisational structures, as well as the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies and offices established pursuant to the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo, fall within the purview of ITF as laid out by the Executive Decision on the Establishment of the Investigation Task Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, dated 21 October 2003.""",introduction investigation task force itf kosovo conduct investigation circumstance surround unmik bank account open bank pristina investigation trigger forensic audit report public enterprise airport pristina peap release february 2003 chartered accountants activity pristina airport fall control kosovo trust agency kta unmik pillar iv administer european union investigations allegation fraud corruption involve unmik pillar organisational structure provisional institutions selfgovernment pisg independent body office establish pursuant constitutional framework provisional selfgovernment kosovo fall purview itf lay executive decision establishment investigation task force unmik ed 2003 16 date 21 october 2003

The DCDM Audit Report 2002/3 highlighted a possible problem with a UNMIK Bank Account, which has been termed the “Company Account”. It was alleged that there was only one signatory to this account (Staff Member 1) and that the interest from this account was going to an unidentified private account.

On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request from UNON Official 1 to inquire into allegations that locally recruited United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the United Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Limited (UN-SACCO), which operates within UNON premises. The request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to UNON Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Children’s Fund/Somalia Support Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary concern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi based United Nations Agencies.",introduction 13 february 2005 investigations division office internal oversight services id oio receive request unon official 1 inquire allegation locally recruit united nations office nairobi unon staff engage improper conduct submit fraudulent letter appointment show long contract duration date obtain loan united nations cooperative savings credit society limited unsacco operate unon premise request prompt early report submit unon management unon official 2 scheme locally recruit staff member nairobibased united nations childrens fund somalia support centre unicef somalia obtain unsacco loan submit fraudulent letter appointment unsacco primary concern unon management similar fraudulent scheme spread unon nairobi base united nations agencies

The primary concern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi based United Nations Agencies. At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investigators were on mission to Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns expressed by UNON Managers, the ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Management to look into this matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 18 February 2005.

69.pdf,"ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or former staff involved in the fraud. For example, one staff member passed away and another, who had left UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UNICEF inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the interviews of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff involved than initially envisaged. During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the concerned UNICEF staff confirmed that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official seal, indicated that they forged the signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that they provided UN-SACCO with incorrect information about the duration of their contracts in order to obtain loans. All of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers, although given the limited responsibilities of some of them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred.
Further, most interviewees stated that they acted alone and, with one exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or UNON colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise aware of or involved in such improper actions.",id oios interview unicef staff staff involve fraud example staff member pass away leave unicef decline interview addition unicef inquiry final information obtain primarily interview unicef staff id oios suggest unicef staff involve initially envisage interview id oios concerned unicef staff confirm misuse unicef letterhead official seal indicate forge signature unicef operations officer provide unsacco incorrect information duration contract order obtain loan mention ease access official unicef stamp stationery computer give limited responsibility example driver access occur interviewee state act exception deny unicef unon colleague assist fraudulent activity aware involve improper action
69.pdf,"Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators noted apparent irregularities concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that their contracts would be renewed beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of those documents and compared them with the corresponding documentation available in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials whose signatures appeared on those letters that they had indeed signed them. The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern that in January 2005, one Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO management that the contract of a particular staff member is likely to be extended for a further two years, subject to satisfactory performance. During the manager’s interview with ID/OIOS, s/he admitted s/he had written a letter at the request of the staff member and advised that such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can obtain loans.

However, these interviews did not produce conclusive information to either suggest or completely rule out improper conduct on the part of UNON staff members. Additional Investigative steps Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that about 2,500 staff members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to similar records from UNON, and the absence of any identified subjects, the ID/OIOS Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases. Files were selected for review where the loan amount was high, the duration of the contract long, or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loans.",interview unsacco unon staff unsacco unon staff member interview id oios investigator provide general information operation cooperate id oios inquiry provide unhindered access file interview produce conclusive information suggest completely rule improper conduct unon staff member additional investigative step documentation obtain unsacco show 2500 staff member unon united nations relate organization request obtain unsacco loan thousand unon staff give large number record review need compare similar record unon absence identify subject id oios investigator decide thorough review sampling case files select review loan high duration contract long applicant guarantor loan

8.pdf,"METHODOLOGY

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm.

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

As a result, on April 24, 2002, the case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought, and clarifying that that only “Compaq, Dell, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation.",february 2002 dpko communications technology services division cits seek obtain new system contract laptop computer mr cabrera procurement officer procurement department pd assign matter chief cits communicate request pd february 25 2002 expression interest issue pd invitation bid follow april 15 2002 transmit 36 vendor country cits advise pd desire ibm dell compaq base itsd standard desktop computer hand pd information technology services division itsd involve process mr bahel recommend add toshiba sony fujitsu nec list subsequent exchange email pd requisitioner cits itsd cits continue assert seek major brand computer avoid inferior product laptop questionable manufacturer clone home build computer ultimately cits agree amenable expand field include major brand computer manufacturer recognize industry leader result april 24 2002 case officer mr cabrera issue bid amendment notification vendor correct anticipated quantity computer seek clarify compaq dell ibm toshiba sony fujitsu nec brand consider solicitation

The remit of the Task Force is to investigate all open and pending procurement cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises, procurement staff, and vendors doing business with the United Nations (hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”). The mandate of the Task Force also includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but it is nevertheless determined that further investigative effort is warranted. The Task Force’s investigations have also focused upon a myriad of individuals and vendors doing business with the Organization. Some of these matters are particularly complex and span significant periods of time. Since its inception, more than 200 matters, involving numerous procurement cases in various UN Missions and UN Headquarters have been referred to the Task Force.

Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awarded to the firm Telecommunications Consultants of India (TCIL). The audit report found significant fraud indicators in connection with the procurement exercises in these contracts, a conclusion with which the Task Force agrees. (The Task Force will report on these issues in much more detail in a subsequent report addressing related matters). However, the focus of this report is upon the conduct of Mr. Cabrera individually, and whether Mr. Cabrera acted improperly in his participation in these matters.",purpose report address matter raise audit finding january 2006 concern walter cabrera united nations procurement officer matter bring attention task force separate referral mr cabrera allege improperly provide notification prospective vendor approval grant favor vendor thunderbird llc thunderbird contract provide manpower support un missions prior official award contract secondly audit report find cabrera engage misconduct connection procurement exercise substantial contract ultimately award firm telecommunications consultants india tcil audit report find significant fraud indicator connection procurement exercise contract conclusion task force agree task force report issue detail subsequent report address relate matter focus report conduct mr cabrera individually mr cabrera act improperly participation matter
82.pdf,"However, the investigation has revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal involvement in ensuring that the vendor, Thunderbird, received advanced notice of the likely award. Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also the only individual associated with the request for expedited approval in a position to seek it. The need for expedited approval for Thunderbird in the first instance and the effort to notify Thunderbird quickly of a likely award is questionable in light of the fact that in the same HCC meeting the current vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two months, and that Thunderbird had failed to submit audited financial statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task. (However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms). Thus, the basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application was still not yet complete. Curiously, there is no request for advanced notification to IECS of the expedited approval of their extension.
While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor, and for the replacement, Thunderbird. The circumstances surrounding the creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first instance are troubling, and are a continued subject of the Task Force’s investigation. However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of the Task Force which demonstrates Mr. Cabrera participated in this aspect of the matter.",investigation reveal mr bahels personal involvement ensure vendor thunderbird receive advanced notice likely award hcc secretary mr bahel individual associate request expedite approval position seek need expedite approval thunderbird instance effort notify thunderbird quickly likely award questionable light fact hcc meet current vendor iecs grant extension continue additional month thunderbird fail submit audit financial statement give additional week accomplish task thunderbird take week file form basis intensive effort mr bahel notify thunderbird problematic especially light fact thunderbirds application complete curiously request advanced notification iecs expedite approval extension minute hcc meeting pende finalize page form issue hcc grant expedite approval continuation current contractor replacement thunderbird circumstance surround creation form request expedite approval instance troubling continued subject task forces investigation present evidence possession task force demonstrate mr cabrera participate aspect matter

In this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them. According to Mr. Cabrera, he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Thunderbird, but was able to give verbal notification of the HCC’s action based upon the document issued by the HCC. Mr. Cabrera’s understanding that this action was permissible was based upon the fact that his supervisor, Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at the time. At the direction of Mr. Bahel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr. Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recommended that the contract be awarded to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird would likely receive the contract. Mr. Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an LOI prior to receiving the approved HCC minutes and formal award of the contract.

In the presentation of the matter to the HCC, officials questioned the basis for limiting the bidding exercise to the three specified brands and intimated that the PD violated UN rules and regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after the event describes a circumstance in which DPKO officials are questioned about the limitation of the re-solicitation to the three preferred brands. The HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee would have recommended that a re-bidding exercise be conducted inviting all brands of laptops that met the UN’s requirement.” Nevertheless, the proposed contract award to TCIL was ultimately approved, and signed.",july 18 2002 sanjaya bahel officer charge procurement time recommend award tcil system contract us5340000 presentation matter hcc official question basis limit bidding exercise specified brand intimate pd violate un rule regulation use brand name itb email communication event describe circumstance dpko official question limitation resolicitation preferred brand hcc state imminent loss fund committee recommend rebidde exercise conduct invite brand laptop meet uns requirement propose contract award tcil ultimately approve sign

The Task Force has not identified any evidence to support a finding that Mr. Cabrera was involved in the decision and the documents demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera continued to maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerning its requests. Further, the Task Force has not identified evidence which suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to cancel the bid, and then seek a re-bidding exercise. The investigation has revealed however that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor, Sanjaya Bahel, was intimately involved in the matter, and interjected himself in it, communicating with ITSD officials and DPKO officials.

In May, 2002, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr. Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, had submitted an application in support of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit proposals on upcoming UN contracts. In July, 2002, after successfully being registered by PD, Thunderbird, through Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal for the supply of engineering manpower to various UN Missions in response to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department. Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts (HCC) in favor of the award to Thunderbird.

82.pdf,"Procurement Department officials concede that at this point there was no further issue and there was no justification not to award the contract to LaCresta. Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation. (Typically the case officer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the vendor.) In this case, there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversations with PD in this interim period, it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an “issue” with LaCresta’s submission. According to the official, the Procurement Department suggested a re-bid because of a “technicality.” While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a commercial one it is only within PD’s prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial non-compliance. This explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issue with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder. Mr. Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffered by PD to the DPKO official is not sound, but takes issue with any claim participation by him in the exchange or decision.",procurement department official concede point issue justification award contract lacresta justification provide la cresta find file la cresta formally informed cancellation typically case officer maintain responsibility communicate cancellation vendor case correspondence case file procurement vendor notify cancellation dpko official involve process inform task force conversation pd interim period represent pd express view issue lacrestas submission accord official procurement department suggest rebid technicality official object tell matter commercial pds prerogative cancel bid basis commercial noncompliance explanation persuasive commercial technical issue lacrestas bid dpko find la cresta compliant firm low bidder mr cabrera agree reasoning proffer pd dpko official sound take issue claim participation exchange decision

Vimont revealed cryptically that the deal is moving forward but did not provide any details. Levitte had not expected to put the labeling dispute with Pernod Ricard (the world's second largest spirits group) on the agenda, but Sarkozy had just spoken to the company's chairman who had asked the president to intercede on his behalf. (COMMENT: Patrick Ricard, chairman of the Pernod Ricard board of directors, is said to be one of Sarkozy's wealthy backers.) Vimont characterized the issue as a very political matter in the U.S., and suggested that a direct appeal to the White House might be useful. While Sarkozy intends to broach the issue with the U.S. President, Levitte will talk to the U.S. President's Economic Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser.

(TS//SI//NF) French President Sarkozy intends to raise a number of sensitive topics with the U.S. President when the two leaders meet in Washington on 31 March, according to an exchange last week between the French ambassador in Washington Pierre Vimont, and Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor, Jean-David Levitte. Vimont conveyed that the French President will express his frustration that Washington has backed away from its proposed bilateral intelligence cooperation agreement and Sarkozy intends to continue to push for closure. As Vimont and Levitte understand it, the main sticking point is the U.S. desire to continue spying on France. On the topic of Afghanistan, Levitte noted that Sarkozy is ready to authorize more military trainers but wants clarification on how many are needed, given the conflicting figures from U.S. sources.""",sensitive issues agenda french president meet week washington tssinf tssinf french president sarkozy intend raise number sensitive topic president leader meet washington 31 march accord exchange week french ambassador washington pierre vimont sarkozys diplomatic advisor jeandavid levitte vimont convey french president express frustration washington back away propose bilateral intelligence cooperation agreement sarkozy intend continue push closure vimont levitte understand main sticking point desire continue spy france topic afghanistan levitte note sarkozy ready authorize military trainer want clarification need give conflict figure source

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999. UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The KTA Divisional Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the ACTS Official.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined.""",background information pristina international airport constitute state own enterprise yugoslavian law asset airport include runway terminal building hang fuel storage facility equipment period cover investigation 2001 2003 maintain public enterprise airport pristina peap cooperation military units kosovo force kfor pursuant united nations security council resolution 1244 date 10 june 1999 unmik regulation 1 1999 date 25 july 1999 unmik mandate administer territory kosovo include state own publicly own asset include pristina international airport 1 july 2002 responsibility administration airport pass pillar ii kosovo trust agency kta pillar iv kta divisional manager appoint airport sector kta time peap official acts official 1 april 2004 pristina international airport time jurisdiction kfor hand civilian jurisdiction icao regulation background change procurement procedure relate follow contract examine

Interception of French Ambassador in Washington Jean-David Levitte reveals his frustration towards a report from Iraq Survey Group and its finding that the UN Oil-for-food program was possibly misused by French companies. In the interception Levitte states that it is scandalous that no U.S. companies are named in the report and claimed that many French companies named were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL) French Ambassador Jean­ David Levitte in Washington plans to respond as early as today to information in the Iraq Survey Group report regarding possible misuse of the UN Oil­for­Food (OFF) program by companies from France and other countries during the former Iraqi regime. The ambassador termed the report scandalous, since it named no U.S. companies and he claimed that many French companies with contracts under the OFF program were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms that also profited from the business dealings. He therefore planned, with foreign ministry backing, to present a list of these U.S. companies to both the U.S. Congress and the media.""",description interception french ambassador washington jeandavid levitte reveal frustration report iraq survey group finding un oilforfood program possibly misuse french company interception levitte state scandalous company name report claim french company name actually subsidiary firm plan present list company congress medium tssi french envoy plans release list firms allegedly profit tssirel usa aus gbr nzl french ambassador jean david levitte washington plan respond early today information iraq survey group report possible misuse un oilforfood program company france country iraqi regime ambassador term report scandalous name company claim french company contract program actually subsidiary firm profit business dealing plan foreign ministry backing present list company congress medium
